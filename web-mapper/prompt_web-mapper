Create a map showing EV charging stations impacted by Hurricane Ian circa 2022. Make it dystopian with a black background and dark colors. The hurricane track should have a 30 mile buffer around it. EV charging stations should be represented by flickering or pulsing in and out yellow symbols. Be creative, please! (Also, please add filters so users can hide and show EV stations by network type. Perhaps symbolize the stations somehow by the number of chargers or fast chargers they have as well. Thanks!
